## About WYZtoSDCCobj

This is a tool to convert export .MUS files from WYZ Tracker to SDCC Assembler files (.s)  
for use with [WYZ Player MSX SDCC Library](https://github.com/mvac7/SDCC_WYZplayer)

In the first version it only allows exporting the code file (.s), 
but the objective is that it can directly compile the Object file (.rel)  
necessary to include it in the projects where it is needed.

This tool is part of the [MSX fR3eL Project](https://github.com/mvac7/SDCC_MSX_fR3eL).

Enjoy it!
